### Remove a game from your account
Sometimes hiding a game from your library isn't enough to hide the sin.

1. Find the game in your Steam library
1. Click on **Support**
1. Select **I want to permanently remove this game from my account**
1. Confirm that you want to lose access to everything in the package the game came in and click on
**Ok, remove the listed games from my account permanently**

If you change your mind and want the game back,
1. Find the support page for the game
    1. Go to the [Games and Applications](https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithGame) section of Steam support
    1. Search for your game  
    If it doesn't show up, the game might have been delisted from Steam.
    1. Search for the game on [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/) and make note of the `appid`
    1. Navigate to https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithGame/?appid=, adding the `appid` to the end of the URL
1. Select **It's not in my library**
1. Select **Restore the previously removed package to my account**

Just like removing a game, adding a game back to your account will restore everything in the package.
